# NJSFA (NJ State Firemen's Association) and LOSAP (Length of Service Award Program) Calculations

## NJSFA  (https://njsfa.com/)
The NJ State Firemen's Association was created in 1846 (https://njsfa.com/historical_record.aspx  and  https://njsfa.com/history_of_association.aspx). The purpose of the association is to permit financial relief for firefighters injured or killed in the line of duty. Money is collected in the form of taxes from insurance companies that do business in NJ. There are other benefits as well (retire in one the NJ Firemen's assisted living homes, etc.). The benefits are available to an individual if he/she has maintained a percentage of work performed or attained their exemption. Exemption is when a firefighter has attended at least 50% of fire department calls and drills for 84 months (seven years). Although each member's percentage is calculated for each month, the data are submitted in January to the state association by each local relief association.

The calculations for maintaining the benefits are as follows:
* Determine the sum of all fires attended by the firefighter;
* Determine the sum of all drills attended by the firefighter (maximum of two per month);
* Determine the total number of fires and drills for the entire company.

For example:
1. if there were 60 fires/emergencies for one month in a fire company's response area, and
2. there were four drills in the month, and
3. a firefighter attended 45 fires and all four company drills during the month;

Calculating percentage to obtain/maintain exemption is:
  * 47 (45 fires + 2 drills, maximum of 2 drills per month)
  * divided by
  * 62 (60 total fires + 2 drills per month)
  * multiplied by 100 (to get a percentage)
  * 47 divided by 62 * 100% = 62.7%.

## LOSAP (https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dlgs/programs/losap.html)
LOSAP is a program where a firefighter/EMT can receive income through a savings plan. The accounts are similar to a 401k and have similar limitations (e.g., five years vesting, cannot withdraw funds except for financial hardship, etc.). LOSAP was setup at the sate level by NJ statute. In order to make this available in each municipality, it must be created by ordinance. The ordinance specifies the members' receiving funds based on attendance at various fire/EMS functions. All monies are added to the accounts annually and are supplied by the municipality only (no funds are deposited by the firefighter).

The calculations for attendance are usually based on attaining a certain number of points. Each category has a set number of points and each individual category usually has a cap. If the sum of all category points adds up to a minimum number (e.g., 150 points) the person is eligible to receive LOSAP funds for that year (i.e., "made LOSAP"). The categories for calculating the annual LOSAP deposit can include:
* fires
* drills
* line/social officer
* meetings
* training/fire school
* miscellaneous work (cleanups, etc.)

The calculations can be anything; generally speaking, there appears to be a template (of sorts) that most fire/EMS companies follow. There are maximum points (caps) associated with each category.
* Fires: calculated in the same manner as calculating NJSFA fire percentage (excluding the drills). There may be a maximum (cap) and minimum required percentage assigned and hence the number of points attained. There may also be rules in the ordinance regarding rounding up/down the percentage.
* Drills: can be the sum of all drills for each month, usually with a cap on the maximum number of drills attended. This can be based on the number of hours for the drills, or one point per drill.
* Line officers/social officers: a "flat rate" associated with each officer. Chief officers usually receive the highest number of points, assistant chiefs slightly lower, etc.
* Meetings: the number of meetings attended.
* Training/fire school: the sum of all training for the year. Depending on the municipal ordinance, this can be points based on each hour of training or the entire day.
* Miscellaneous: the sum of all miscellaneous work performed (wash bay floors, wash apparatus, etc.). This can also be based on hours or an entire day.

The earned column is the number of points that the individual actually attended. The cap is the maximum number of points allowed by the ordinance. The allowed column is the lesser of the two columns. Using the same calculation above for NJSFA for fires (percentage), one member attended the following.

| Category | Earned | Cap | Allowed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fires | 62.5 | 60 | 60 |
| drills | 48 | 40 | 40 |
| lieutenant | 25 | (no cap) | 25 |
| meetings | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| training | 100 | 50 | 50 |
| miscellaneous | 72 | 40 | 40 |
| totals | 319.5 | 227 | 227 |

The sum of points in the "allowed" column is 227. If the minimum number of points to achieve LOSAP is 150, this person satisfied the commitment to receive their annual allowance.
